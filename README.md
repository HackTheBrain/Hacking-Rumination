# Hacking-Rumination

## WHO?
Paulien Routs – Designer 
Delany Boutkan – Designer 
Charalampos Papaloizou - Programmer

## WHY?
Our concept is rooted in our research on the depressed brain, rumination means a thought spiral you get into when you drop concentration and your mind starts wandering. When you suffer from depression this becomes a negative thought spiral and we wanted to create a product that makes sure you get some positive input when you drop concentration and your mind wanders, a positive instead of negative rumination, supporting the wellbeing of the depressed brain on a daily basis.

## WHAT?
A proposal / prototype for a system that uses the data of the ratio between beta & theta wave to activate a scent dispenser that could sent out a scent that potentially has a positive effect on the mind wandering of the person wearing it. Scents have been proven to have positive effects on the brain, so once a person finds the scent that has a proven positive effect on his / her brain the scent dispenser could be adjusted to his / her preference. 

## HOW?
We used a muse and an arduino. And python, django, javascript and pyserial to code the arduino to make the scent dispenser go off.
